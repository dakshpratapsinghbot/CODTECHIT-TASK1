Overview of the Project

Project Overview: Basic Arithmetic Calculator in Python
Objective:
The main goal of this project is to create a simple yet functional calculator using Python's tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The program allows users to input two numbers, select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), and then calculate and display the result.

Key Activities:
Designing the User Interface (UI):

Utilize the tkinter library to create the main window, input fields, operation selection options, and result display area.
Implementing Core Functionality:

Set up the calculator to handle basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Implement input validation to ensure that users provide numerical input and handle division by zero.
Integrating Input and Output:

Use Entry widgets to capture user input for the two numbers.
Employ Radiobutton widgets for users to select the desired arithmetic operation.
Display the calculation result using a Label widget.
Error Handling:

Implement error messages for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input, division by zero).
Technology Used:
Python: The core programming language used for developing the calculator.
Tkinter: Python's standard GUI library, used to create the application's user interface.
Key Insights:
Ease of Use: Python's tkinter library offers a simple way to create a GUI-based application, making it accessible even for beginners.
User Input Validation: Proper input validation is crucial for a seamless user experience, ensuring that the program behaves correctly even with invalid or unexpected input.
Modularity: The project demonstrates how small, modular functions (like calculate()) can be used to build a complete application with clear, manageable code.
This project serves as a foundational example of how to combine Python's programming capabilities with a GUI framework to create interactive applications.
